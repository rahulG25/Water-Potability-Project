# water-potability
CONTEXT:
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection.
This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that
investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health
care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

content:
The water_potability.csv file contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies.
The inputs used in the projects are ph_value, hardness, solid, Chloramines,	Sulfate,	Conductivity,	Organic_carbon,	Trihalomethanes,	Turbidity.
The output in this project is potability.If potability is zero then the water is non drinkable else the water is drinkable. 

In this project I got good accuracy in Light GBM model,so i'm used that model in my project.Deployment done in streamlit method.
